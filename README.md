# Pulverizr

Pulverizr will smash your images down to size. It uses a number of free, and
often times open source, programs to optimize and compress image files while
still retaining their original appearance.

While modern image editor's, like Photoshop's, compressors do a decent job at
cutting the extra fat around images, they sometimes leave behind extras you
probably don't want or need. For example, EXIF data in JPEGs, color-correction
data in PNGs and redundant frames in GIFs.

Pulverizr uses a handful of compressors to perform a number of lossless
compression routines to squeeze every last bit out of your images (see
**Dependencies**). Note this software isn't 100% stable yet. You may notice
differences in images that may contain certain color profiles that can be
stripped out by the compressors. Any strangeness you see, [please report
it](http://github.com/bentruyman/pulverizr/issues)!

Pulverizr is completely written in JavaScript intended to run in a
[NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) environment. This means any idiot front-end
developer such as myself can pick up the code and easily understand what's
going on. Also, any normal developer could also pick it up and fix all the
mistakes I made.

## Dependencies

If you're on Ubuntu, almost all of these dependencies can be retrieved using
**apt**. Although Pulverizr works best with all its dependencies, it will
gracefully fail when it doesn't find a compressor it's looking for.

The compressors Pulverizr uses are admittedly a bit obscure and sometimes
difficult to install on all platforms.

* [gifsicle](http://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/) 1.58+
* [libjpeg](http://www.ijg.org/) (or **libjpeg-progs** if you're using
  **apt**)
* [optipng](http://optipng.sourceforge.net/) 0.6.3+
* [pngcrush](http://pmt.sourceforge.net/pngcrush/) 1.7.0+

### On Mac OSX

If you're using [homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/), install the
following packages:

    brew install gifsicle libjpeg optipng pngcrush

### On Ubuntu

To install the dependencies on Ubuntu:

    apt-get install gifsicle libjpeg-progs optipng pngcrush

### On Windows

Good luck to you, fine sir.

## Installation

    npm install -g pulverizr

## Usage

**Note: Be sure to test before you overwrite your images by using `--dry-run`**

Usage: pulverize [options] <file...>

    Options:

      -h, --help        output usage information
      -V, --version     output the version number
      -a, --aggressive  Uses more aggressive compression algorithms (takes longer, works better)
      --dry-run         Print summary but don't actually modify files
      -q, --quiet       Pulverizer will not report
      -R, --recursive   Recurse through directories
      -v, --verbose     Verbose mode

### Single File

    pulverize image.png
    
### Single Directory

    pulverize /var/www/mysite.com/images/products/backgrounds

### Multiple Files

    pulverize foo.png bar.png baz.png qux.png

### Recursive Directory

    pulverize -R -- /var/www/mysite.com/images

### Aggressive Recursive Directory

    pulverize -aR -- /var/www/mysite.com/images

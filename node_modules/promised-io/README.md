Promised-IO is a cross-platform package for asynchronous promise-based IO. Promises
provide a simple robust mechanism asynchronicity with separation of concerns by encapsulating
eventual completion of an operation with side effect free callback registration
separate from call invocation. Promised-IO provides cross-platform 
file, HTTP, and system interaction with promises for asynchronous operations.

Promised-IO also utilizes "lazy arrays" for progressively completed 
actions or for streaming of data. Lazy arrays provide all the standard iterative Array methods for
receiving callbacks as actions are completed. Lazy arrays are utilized
for progressive loading of files and HTTP responses.   

Promised-IO is part of the Persevere project, and therefore is licensed under the
